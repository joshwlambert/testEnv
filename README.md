The goal of testEnv is to setup renv.

This package contains a minimal package example, including a function that 
requires a couple of dependencies, some data, a data-raw files which creates
and saves the data and requires other dependencies which are listed in Suggests.
Therefore it serves a minimal case to setup and familiarise `renv` with.
